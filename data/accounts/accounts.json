Phase III enrichment reveals active Epic implementation with critical timing signals: Epic negotiations began September 2024, AI suite adoption occurred November 2025, and new CIO appointment in November 2025 signals organizational commitment to EHR transformation. The organization's 19,600-employee scale combined with 70+ facilities requiring Epic training creates significant VILT opportunity, though absence of confirmed LMS or virtual classroom infrastructure indicates they are not yet equipped for scaled virtual delivery.",
