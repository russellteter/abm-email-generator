  "discovery_notes": "Exceptional contact coverage for Kaleida Health's 13-system Epic consolidation project. The organization has made multiple strategic hires specifically for the Epic implementation: Leslie Brookins (Epic Implementation Director from Saint Luke's), Jennifer Meyer (Nursing Informatics from UPMC), and Kristian Feterik (CHIO from UPMC with Epic Physician Builder experience). The CIO Courtney Starnes brings unique perspective having started her career at Cerner - she understands both vendor and provider sides of EHR implementations. Dawn Tymorek as Manager EHR Training is the direct operational contact for training delivery decisions. The 200-employee Epic implementation team mentioned in research is likely led by Leslie Brookins with Dawn Tymorek managing training specifically. Strong alignment opportunity: CIO and Epic Director both came from Saint Luke's Health System, suggesting they may be open to solutions they've used before.",
