Note potential CIO discrepancy: research mentions Justin Ott as CIO who led Oracle Health vendor selection, but ZoomInfo shows Chris Stevens as VP & CIO. May be leadership transition or organizational structure - verify before outreach. Ashley Dennis (Director, Medical Education) is excellent secondary contact for CME/training programs."
